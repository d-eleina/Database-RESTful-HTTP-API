       <h3>Creating: Adding Data for a new photo item</h3>
       <p>If the user is inteding to add new data to the database, they will need to launch a POST request to the following URI: http://localhost:3000/api/photos.</p>
          
          <p>Shall all go well, the status code should be 200-OK ( or 201-Created) . If codes 400 or 505 show up, then it means there were issues encountered with the server while processing the request. </p>
         
          <p><strong>Example</strong></p>
          <p>If the user is intending to add data for a new photo, they will need to follow these steps:</p>

       <p>note: the added id <strong>needs</strong> to be a number.</p>

          <p><strong>Example</strong></p>
          <p>If the user wishes to get only the data of a specific item, they should follow these steps : </p>

          <h3>Updating: Changing the data of a specific item</h3>
       <p>To update any existing items from the database, the user will need to launch a PUT request to the following URI: http://localhost:3000/api/photos/id.</p>
       <p>note: here the "id" at the end of the URI reffers to the id of the item the user is intending to update, and it <strong>needs</strong> to be a number.</p>
          <p>Shall everything go well, status code 200-OK can be expected. If the 404-Not Found response code show up, then it means that the user is trying to update the data of an non existent item. Codes 400 and 500 represent server issues.   </p>
          
          <p><strong>Example</strong></p>
          <p>If instead of retrieving data, the user wishes to update the data of an existing item, they should do the following : </p>
          <pre>
          <strong>

          <h3>Deleting: Removing data of a specific item</h3>
       <p>For deleting the data of a specific item, the user needs to put out a DELETE request to the following URI: http://localhost:3000/api/photos/id.</p>
       <p>note: just like before, the "id" at the end of the URI reffers to the id of the item the user is intending to update, and it needs to be a number.</p>
        
          <p>Shall the DELETE request be successful, the expected status code is 200-OK. If the 404-Not Found response code shows up, it means that the user is trying to delete the data of a non-existing item. Codes 400 and 500 represent server issues. </p>
          
          <p><strong>Example</strong></p>
          <p>If the user wants to delete the data of a specific item, they need to do the following: </p>
          
          <pre><strong>
            async function deleteDataById(id) {

       //after doing this, the function can be called and passed the          correct parameter
            let idToDelete = desiredId ( replace with actual ID );
          await deleteDataById(idToDelete);
